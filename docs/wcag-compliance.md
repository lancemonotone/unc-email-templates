# MJML Partial WCAG 2.2 AA Compliance Review

## Task

Review the following list of MJML partial files to ensure they contribute to a WCAG 2.2 AA compliant HTML email template. Identify deficiencies and suggest specific code changes within the MJML files to address them.

**Context:** These partials are included in various email templates. Remember the limitations of HTML email clients (especially Outlook) when suggesting solutions. Focus on practical and widely supported accessibility improvements.

## Files for Review

This list represents the "deepest" included files that contain the direct rendering markup for the `templates/3_Basic-Hero-One-CTA-Blue.mjml` template:

1.  `templates/partials/headers/bear-mono-blue.mjml`
2.  `templates/partials/components/component-image-hero-full-width.mjml`
3.  `templates/partials/components/component-h1.mjml`
4.  `templates/partials/components/component-text.mjml`
5.  `templates/partials/components/component-button-blue-center.mjml`
6.  `templates/partials/components/component-h2.mjml`
7.  `templates/partials/blocks/block-callout-box-button-blue-center.mjml`
8.  `templates/partials/footers/social/social-elements.mjml`
9.  `templates/partials/footers/footer-bear-split.mjml`

## Instructions for AI Assistant

1.  **Goal:** Achieve WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance as much as possible within the constraints of HTML email.
2.  **Analyze Each File:** Go through each file in the list above.
3.  **Identify Issues:** Look for common WCAG failures, including but not limited to:
    - **Semantic Structure:** Ensure proper use of headings (`mj-title`, `mj-text` with appropriate roles or classes if possible), lists, etc. Can `role` attributes be added effectively in MJML for landmarks (banner, main, contentinfo)?
    - **Images (`mj-image`):** Verify meaningful `alt` text for all non-decorative images. Ensure decorative images have `alt=""`. Check if roles like `role="presentation"` are needed.
    - **Links (`mj-button`, links in `mj-text`):** Ensure link text is descriptive or has an accessible name (e.g., using `mj-attributes` for `aria-label` if possible). Check for sufficient contrast for text/buttons against backgrounds.
    - **Color Contrast:** Verify text and background color combinations meet the 4.5:1 ratio (3:1 for large text). Pay attention to text within images or buttons. Use tools if necessary.
    - **Tables (`mj-table` or tables generated by columns):** If tables are used for layout (common with MJML columns), ensure they have `role="presentation"`. Data tables (if any) need proper headers and scope.
    - **Focus Indicators:** While difficult in email, can any visual focus indication be added for interactive elements (buttons, links)? Explore CSS options compatible with email clients.
    - **Language:** Ensure the main language is set (`lang` attribute on `mj-body` or `mjml` tag if possible, or ensure it's set in the final HTML).
4.  **Suggest MJML Fixes:** For each issue found, provide specific, corrected MJML code snippets for the relevant partial file. Explain _why_ the change is needed.
5.  **Consider Email Client Limitations:** Acknowledge that perfect compliance might be impossible (e.g., full ARIA support, complex JS). Prioritize fixes that work across major clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail). Avoid solutions known to break in Outlook (like extensive use of `div`s or modern CSS properties).
6.  **Output Format:** Clearly state the file being reviewed, the issue found (referencing the specific WCAG Success Criterion if possible), and the suggested MJML code correction.
