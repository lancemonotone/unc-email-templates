## Verification Summary

- **Directories scanned**: 6 directories
- **Total MJML files found**: 78 files
- **Files confirmed in use**: 67 files
- **Files confirmed unused**: 11 files
- **No phantom directories**: All listed files actually exist

## Methodology

1. Systematically scanned each directory with `list_dir`
2. Cross-referenced every found file against `in-use.md`
3. Only included files that physically exist but are not referenced
4. Removed all previously incorrect entries (non-existent directories)

## Recommendation

These 11 files are safe candidates for archival or deletion since they are not referenced anywhere in the active template system.
