7. When generating Git commit messages, start with the type of commit (Feature, Fix, Chore, Refactor, etc.) and a colon.

16. UNBIASED 50/50  
    Before you answer, I want you to write two detailed paragraphs, one for each solution. Do not jump to conclusions or commit to either solution until you have fully considered both. Then tell me which solution is obviously better and why.
17. PROPERLY FORMED SEARCH QUERY  
    Your task is to write a one-paragraph search query as if you were instructing a human researcher. Clearly state what to find and request code snippets or technical details when relevant.
18. START WITH UNCERTAINTY  
    You should start the reasoning paragraph with lots of uncertainty and slowly gain confidence as you think about the item more.
19. BE CAREFUL WITH RED HERRINGS
